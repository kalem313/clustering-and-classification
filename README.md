In this assignment I will work on **song features** and how they can be used as the basis for recommendations for specific daily activities.

The study I used for this assignment:

* _Kim, Y., Aiello, L.M. & Quercia, D. PepMusic: motivational qualities of songs for daily activities. EPJ Data Sci. 9, 13 (2020)._ https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-0221-9

You can download the study from the above link. 

This project has two phases: **Clustering** and **Classification**. 

The optimal clusters that were found (using the elbow method) is three.

The classifiers that were built are the following: 

1. **Tree-based models**:
    _Scikit-learn's Random Forest
    XGBoost
    LightGBM
    CatBoost_

2. **Neural Network-based model**
